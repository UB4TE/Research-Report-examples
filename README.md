# Research-Report-examples
Some of the research reports from my Bachelor program at Noroff.
I have included an OSINT investigation reports from my teams second year of study. We analyzed whether open source intelligence could give insights to events 
compariable to paid services. The goal was aimed at smaller businesses that were affected by riots in the US during 2020. They cannot afford to pay for threat intelligence from the leading providers. If they have an interest could a framework help them. 

The third report is my Bachelor project from third year. I investigated existing research on technology and information warfare. The question I wanted to answer was "Does adopting technology make a society more vulnerable to informaiton warfare?"
